Grails Domain Templates allows you to dynamically extend domain classes with unlimited user definable fields based on a Template for a specific Domain Class.
If you, for example, have a Company Domain Class, but companies would like to register different fields for such an entity, several Templates could be created
for every type of company (e.g. a financial institution template, university template, etc). Using these Templateted Domain Classed creates more dynamic
flexibility in the application.
